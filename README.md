The sinking of the [RMS Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing **1502** out of **2224** passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.


One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were **more likely to survive** than others, such as **women, children, and the upper-class.**

We create a Machine Learning model which performs [K-means Clustering](https://www.datascience.com/blog/k-means-clustering) on [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) Dataset to cluster the percentage of people who survived. We Drop the **Survived** feature from the Dataset to make this an [Unsupervised Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) Technique.
